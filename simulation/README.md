# ðŸ”‹ Energy Flow Simulation and Battery Interaction Tool

This script simulates energy flows in a solar+battery+grid setup. It models:
- **Solar energy production**
- **Battery charging/discharging behavior**
- **Grid import/export**
- **Local energy consumption**
  
It also provides a visualization of energy flow and battery state of charge (SoC) over time.
